When the user declares a "new" type inside a module,
should the operations declared on that new type
become directly visible.  Seems reasonable.

Now what about another "new" type defined in terms of a
prior "new" type?  Do these "inherit" these operations?
That begins to get complex, and implies we need to keep
track of the lineage.  Preferable would be "new or
not new."

New types need conversion operations.  Can they define
their own?  That would seem to be ambiguous, and if they
are really that different, then they should be defined
by different modules.
