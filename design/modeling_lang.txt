Using ParaSail/Sparkel as a modeling language.

---  January 2016 ---

A model is like a graph, where signals are edges, and blocks are the nodes.
A given block would have some number of input signals and some number
of output signals.  Signals and blocks would be assigned unique IDs,
much like edges and nodes.  In addition, there would be signal objects
and block objects, which would be tables indexed by their signal IDs
and block IDs.

We would also have value types, such as int16, int32, 2x2 mat of int16, etc.
Signals would be parameterized by the value type, and the value type of
the outputs would generally be a function of the value type of the inputs.
Signal type checking would be performed either statically (ideal), or
as the model is created (which would also be before simulation began). 
Note that some subsystems would be generic on value type.  In that case,
you wouldn't get any checking when you define the new block "type" -- you would
only find out when you instantiate the block with input signals.  Not the
end of the world, but not ideal either.  Conceivably ParaScope could help
here, to prove that the constructor won't fail with a type mismatch.
Pre/postconditions would give plenty of flexibility.  More so than just
a simple type matching mechanism.

A "library" is really just a bunch of module/class/type definitions.  The
"create" constructor for a library subsystem/block would create a network
of sub-blocks.  A network/subsystem/model/sub-model is something to which
you can add blocks connected by signals.  The compute/update/init operations
are implemented in terms of the corresponding compute/update/init operations
of the sub-blocks.

You can implement new block classes/types from scratch, but then you must
define the compute/update/init operations.  All of these need to implement
the block interface.

A signal may be created in advance to produce feedback loops, etc.  But by
default the output signals of a block can be used directly as input signals
for the successor blocks in the network.  If a signal is defined in advance,
it needs to be connected as an output.  Conceivably it could be passed in
as a parameter during creation, which by default would create new signals
for each output.

We should think of a model as being represented as something like XML,
on disk.  We probably don't want a model to be an "active" object.
We could have references to user-defined functionality, but the model
should not "contain" that functionality.  We separately will have to
define the extra classes, etc., which will implement special blocks.
The references probably want to be unique strings, perhaps using the
XML "namespace" notion to provide some hierarchical naming, though
the names could presumably have "."s, "-"s, or equivalent in them.

The Simulink S-Function represents a primitive "block" in a Simulink model.

Each S-Function is in charge of a vector "x" of internal state,
by defining the derivative (continuous) or the next-sample-time value
(discrete)for each element of x.  It is also in charge of providing
outputs y.  It has some number of inputs "u".  The outputs "y" are
defined in terms of the x internal-state vector and the u input vector.

S-functions can detect "zero crossings" (is that when some value
of x goes from one side of zero to another, or when the derivative
crosses zero?)

Simulink C S-functions have the following operations:
  * MdlInitializeSizes  -- Initialize the sizes portion of the simulation
                           structure using ssSet macros.
  * MdlInitializeSampleTimes -- Initialize the sample times and offsets.
  * MdlOutputs          -- Compute outputs
  * MdlTerminate        -- Perform any necessary end-of-simulation tasks.
 Optional operations:
  * mdlSetInputPortWidth -- Use to override dfault scalar expansion rules
                           for inherited port widths
  * mdlSetOutputPortWidth -- Use to override default scalar expansion rules
                           for inherited port widths
  * mdlSetInputPortSampleTime  -- Override inherited sample times
  * mdlSetOutputPortSampleTime -- Override inherited sample times
  * mdlSetWorkWidths    -- Use if work-vector widths are func of port widths
  * mdlInitializeConditions -- Set initial value of contin and discrete parts
                           of state vector.  Function needed if any states;
                           called again if block in reinitialized subsystem.
  * mdlStart            -- Perform one-time initialization, typically of
                           work vectors.
  * mdlCheckParameters  -- Check block parameters; should be called at start;
                           Simulink calls any time parameters change.
  * mdlProcessParameters -- Called by Simulink after mdlCheckParameters;
                           should also be called from mdlStart.
  * mdlGetTimeOfNextVarHit -- Compute time of next sample
  * mdlUpdate           -- Update values of discrete components of state;
                           will be called once for each sample hit; if there
                           are multiple sample times, must include logic
                           to decide which components to update.
  * mdlDerivatives      -- Set values of derivatives of contin components.

 mdlInitializeSizes expects the following sizes to be specified:
   NumContStates, NumDiscStates, NumOutputs, NumInputs, DirectFeedThrough,
   NumSampleTimes, NumInputArgs, NumIWork, NumRWork, NumPWork, Options
   [NOTE: NumIWork, NumRWork, and NumPWork determine persistent "work"
    vector sizes]

 mdlInitializeSampleTimes expects calls on ssSetSampleTime (S, n, T)
   one for each NumSampleTimes, with n going 0 .. NST-1; may also
   call ssSetOffsetTimes (S, n, Offset)

 State variables, block inputs and outputs

Signals should have units, precision, scale factors, matrix dimensions, ...

Operations include initialization, derivative calculation, next-step value,
etc.
