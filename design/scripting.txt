We claim that scripting languages don't need to be dynamically typed to be
friendly and productive.  By providing convenient default types for
literals and aggregates, we can minimize the amount of explicit mention
of types.  Specifying types of formal parameters is just good sense, and
there really is no advantage of leaving them off.  ParaSail allows a type
name to substitute for a parameter name, so in cases where there is only
one parameter of a given type, that is a simple short-hand.

We would want to add implicitly-typed "Set" and "Map" (aka Dictionary)
aggregates.  We would determine the Set/Map type to use based on
the range of types in the initial aggregate.  If it is empty, we would
look forward in the program for what types are being added, or we could
assume Imageable+.
