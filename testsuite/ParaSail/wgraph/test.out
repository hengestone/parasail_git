Roots of graph:
 #hello
Leaves of graph:
 #stranger
All nodes, and their successors:
Successors of #hello (node 1)
 #there, weight = 3.5
 #stranger, weight = 1.1
Successors of #there (node 2)
 #stranger, weight = 2.2
Successors of #stranger (node 3)
BFS(Gr, [1], lambda (G, N) -> Boolean is (G[N] == #stranger)) = 3
