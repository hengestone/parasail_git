This implementation of K-Means was based on one created by Andrea Ferretti.
Please visit: https://github.com/andreaferretti/kmeans for the original.

This version is designed to execute faster with the current ParaSail
compiler and run-time.  See ../kmeans for a version based more closely
on Andrea Ferretti's original.
This reads points from the "points.json" file in ../kmeans.
