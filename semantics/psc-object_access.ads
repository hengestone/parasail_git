package PSC.Object_Access is
   --  Keep track of which sets of objects are read and written
   --  by different parts of a program tree.  This is used
   --  to detect illegal aliasing and possible race conditions.

   type Read_Write_Combination_Enum is
     (Not_Combined, Sequential, Within_Operation, Uplevel_Refs, Parallel);
   --  How read/write access should be combined over a list
   --  of trees.
   --  "Not_Combined" means each element is independent.
   --  There is no carryover.
   --  Sequential means there is never a conflict, but the accesses
   --  are combined.
   --  Within_Operation means that these are parameters to an operation
   --  and there should be no aliasing between parameters that can have
   --  a subcomponent updated and any other parameter.
   --  Uplevel_Refs means that the Read_Write_Mapping being added in
   --  corresponds to uplevel references, which might conflict with
   --  other updates being performed via parameters.
   --  Parallel means the operations might execute in parallel.

   type Access_Mode_Enum is (
     No_Access,
     Param_Computation,

     Ref_Const_Access,
     Ref_Var_Access,
     Read_Access,
     Update_Access);
   --  Kind of access performed on an object
   --  Param_Computation means that a parameter is computed,
   --  but not yet used for anything.
   --  Ref_Access means that a reference is made to the
   --  object, and it is potentially incorporated into the
   --  result of the operation.  This implies a Read_Access to the
   --  object, and possibly a later write access when the operation result
   --  is used.  Ref_Var_Access implies an immediate write to the
   --  object, as well as a writable-ref incorporated into the operation
   --  result.  Ref_Const_Access implies an immedate read as well as a
   --  possible future read.

   --  Objects are sorted into one of the following in the read-write map
   subtype Recorded_Access_Mode_Enum is
     Access_Mode_Enum range Ref_Const_Access .. Update_Access;
